The `Ugloo` team reached several ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· _Cloud Service Providers_  
to enrich the software with essential functionalities these specific stakeholders require.
{ .alert .alert-warning }

## White label sales

In order to make the solution available to its end customers while requiring as little integration as possible, the `Ugloo` interface can be configured in the colors of your company.

## Multi-tenancy / service accounts

_Cloud Service Providers_ specifically need:

- to make the software available to their end customers
- from a shared platform
- while offering a total guarantee of isolation between each client resources

To do so, `Ugloo` offers a feature where each client has its dedicated **_tenant_** and is technically **isolated** from other _tenants_.  
Service accounts allow each _tenant_ to be managed and used in isolation.

## Pay-as-you-go billing

The latest **enriched observability** features make it possible to very closely monitor the uses and consumption of each user, each _tenant_:

- volumetry,
- number of inputs/outputs,
- reading/writing,
- objects count,
- mutations count on objectsâ€¦  
  
These detailed metrics allow each _Cloud Service Providers_ to build their invoicing model as they wish (see [Observability](../observability)).

## Pricing either in subscription mode (_OPEX_) or acquisition mode (_CAPEX_)

On the other hand, as a `Ugloo` customer, the _Cloud Service Provider_ can choose to be billed either in subscription mode (_OPEX_) or in acquisition mode (_CAPEX_), in order to best optimize its commercial strategy, and its own cash flow (see [Sales strategy](../sale-strategy)).
