# Main pros of Ugloo software

Thanks to its **exclusive and patented** architecture, `Ugloo` will allow you to:

1. store your data
2. over the medium/long term
3. in a safe, secure and cyber-attack resistant way
4. at a reasonnable cost
5. on-premises, and/or in the Cloud
6. over one/many sites

## Optimize your storage costs!

`Ugloo` is a software solution that works with any _commodity hardware_‚Ä¶ _On-premises_, in the _Cloud_, or even on your fleet of workstations.

- **Edge storage** - make the most of the space available on your infrastructure.
- **Commodity hardware** - use standard commodity and cheaper servers.
- **Elastic provisionning** - scale the capabilities of the solution with your needs (‚¨ÜÔ∏è and ‚¨áÔ∏è).

## S√©curity

- **Immutable data** ‚Äì impossible to encrypt / alter / erase / falsify the data
- **Fault tolerant** ‚Äì resists the loss of a disk / node / site or even region
- **GeoCluster** ‚Äì resists the loss of a region / host
- **Permanent checking** ‚Äì permanent check and rebuild of data

`Ugloo` is a modern solution: the configuration and orchestration of the _cluster_ are largely automated.
{ .alert .alert-warning }

- **Web graphical user interface** - up-to-date and user-oriented
- **Elastic provisionning** - dynamically add/remove storage nodes
- **AWS¬†S3 protocol** - facilitates migrations from `AWS` and developments towards multi-_cloud_
- **Object storage** - no need to fear _filesystem_ limitations
- **Easy to install and use** - Ugloo can be installed as _VMs_ or `Docker` _containers_. `Ansible`-script installer. _Load-balancer_ included.

## Versatile

`Ugloo` is a versatile software, which can be deployed on heterogeneous _commodity hardware_.  
Whether _On-premises_, in the _Cloud_, with a more or less traditional hoster, or even on your fleet of workstations.  
Whether on physical machines, _VMs_, or on a _container_ platform.  
`Ugloo` knows how to respond to **any need for object storage**.

- **Backup software integration** ‚Äì Ugloo is certified for `Commvault` / `Rubrik` / `Veeam` (Veeam Ready, SOS¬†API), `Atempo` (Miria, TINA). [Read more‚Ä¶](/features/backup-backend/)
- **PACS/DICOM** ‚Äì native support for medical imaging **DICOM** protocol. [Read more‚Ä¶](/features/dicom/)
- **AWS¬†S3 protocol** ‚Äì facilitates migrations from `AWS` and developments towards multi-_cloud_. [Read more‚Ä¶](/features/aws-s3-compatibility)
- **Object storage** ‚Äì no need to fear _filesystem_ limitations
